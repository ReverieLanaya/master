        Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska has been described as a “Mozart of poetry”, her words falling into place with a veritable ease. 
        She wrote around 400 poems during her lifetime, using common everyday images to reflect on larger truths about love, death and passing time. In 1996 she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature “for poetry that with ironic precision allows the historical and biological context to come to light in fragments of human reality.”
