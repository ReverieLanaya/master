                <p>Nico Robin was born on the island of Ohara and came from a family of archaeologists. Her mother, Nico Olvia, went out to sea to find the True History when Robin was two years old, leaving her in the care of Olvia's brother and his wife, Roji. While Robin's father was never revealed, Olvia stated that she will honor her husband's dream, she then left to study the poneglyphs. Robin later wandered into the Tree of Knowledge and was allowed to read the books held within on Clover's invitation.</p>
